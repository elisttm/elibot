9/15/2021 - 9/22/2021
- made massnick more user friendly; renamed subcommands & added more checks
- reworked some admin commands like presence, toggle, and admin/cog list
- combined command list and config vars into 1 file
- combined the settings list and setting management functions into one command
- added permission checks in settings for roles/channels
- changed the about command to use application info instead of preset text
- massively cleaned up and optimized some really bad code in events
- added a system for command statistics
- added AllowedMentions to replace what i was doing before
- revamped how tags are stored, instead of being in 1 document theyre all stored individually and dates are now stored as unix timestamps (also just made a lot of stuff faster)
- made some indivual functions for database management since i was kind of overdoing how far i could go with using as few as possible lol
- (i didnt finish everything i wanted to but im making a commit here just for the sake of it)

9/13/2021 - 9/14/2021
- massnick works correctly again and is now way faster
- added toggle command so i can globally disable commands for maintenance 
- reworded/reformatted some error messages and starting logs
- (tags) redid a few checks and removed some overall redundancy

i probably should have started writing one of these earlier but whatever
